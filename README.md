This is a branch where i explore asynchonous mapping, which is going to use more colours (red green blue, yellow, cyan, magenta), better stabilization, faster mapping, and doesn't need a bluetooth or websocket connection anymore.

status: not really doing something useful yet

problems:
camera capture doesnt seem to properly respond to exposure time settings. it is hard to get pictures that are not over saturated. This makes it harder to detect colours (they are washed out).
I need to colours to encode a starting pattern. without a start pattern i cannot determine which picture corresponds to the start of the code.
