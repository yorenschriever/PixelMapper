image stabilization

status: kind of working, but maybe i have overfitted the stabilization params on the small testset of 5 states that i was using.
For images taken with a tripod i got worse results when stabilizing. i tried to work around that by detecting a tripod during capture.
This verison is probably usable, but doesnt feel stable enough to merge to the main version.
